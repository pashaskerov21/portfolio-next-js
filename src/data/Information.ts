    aboutText: "Hello! I'm Alipasha, a full-stack developer specializing in both frontend and backend development. Creating interactive and user-oriented web applications has become not just a job but also a passion for me. I especially prefer TypeScript with modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as Next.js and React.js. By using these technologies, I aim to create powerful and scalable backend systems that prioritize user experience. I also work with a robust and flexible backend framework like Laravel, so I can build both sides of my projects on a solid foundation. While doing my work, I always stick to the latest technologies and best practices, while also being a stickler for clean code writing and maintainable architectures. I am passionate about bringing a unique perspective and creative solutions to each project. Doing business with me means not only delivering a project but also developing a long-term business partnership. I strive to understand my customers' needs and meet them in the best way, and I am committed to delivering my projects on time and within budget. I look forward to helping you succeed in your projects. I am always open to communicate, so feel free to contact me.",
